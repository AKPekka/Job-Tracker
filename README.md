# ðŸ§­ Project Brief: Job Search Tracker Dashboard

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Build a **personal job application tracker dashboard** that allows the user (me) to log, manage, and analyze the status of job applications in a structured and intuitive way. This is not a multi-user application and does not require authentication.

The system should allow input of job listings, track progress through application stages, store recruiter/interview details, and visualize the process with simple analytics.
